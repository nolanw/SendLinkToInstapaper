Send Link to Instapaper
=======================

The [Instapaper bookmarklet](http://www.instapaper.com/extras) is awesome, but sometimes there are [lists of dozens links whose pages I don't want to open just to save the linked page to Instapaper](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/the-best-magazi.php).

This Safari 5 extension adds a "Send to Instapaper" contextual menu item to links.
